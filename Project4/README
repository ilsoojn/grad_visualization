This Program is to Analyse the Network Traffics in the All Friehgt Corporation Network.
Given three different type of the Log files - Firewall Log, IDS Log, and Security Log; the program takes firewall log file to draw a xy-plot graph and undirect graph.

XY-plot graph shows the change in the number of connection/disconnection on each servers as the time goes. The servers includes File Server, Mail Server, Internal Web Server, Database Servers, and DNS servers.

Undirect graph shows the connection/disconnection of the IP Addersses at certain time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage (after cmake/make):

Start- ./cnoSituationAware <FirewallLog File1> ... <FirewallLog File n> <,>
While running - dd/Mmm/yyyy hh:mm:ss (to display the new graph with choice of date & time)
				[to see the new graph, close the current viewing window.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug:
	Slider Not working due to the segmentation fault.
	SEGMENTATION fault on the mouse click/moves on the graph viewing window.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future Work:
	- Fixing the Segmentation bug 
	- Functions for the IDS and Security Logs
