CEG 7650 Visualization & Image Processing

14 April 2016

This program segments background & foreground using built-in openCV background subtractor.
After run the program following windows will show up (windows might be top of each other; move windows to see them):
	Foreground Background Subtraction : moving object from the input video after using BackgroundSubtractorMOG2
	Background Canny Edge Detection : background scene + Canny Edge Detection 
									(used Histogram Comparason method to get frames while camera was moving)
	Visual Image Process : Foreground + Background images (which is equal to output video result)
	Original Video: original input video for comparason
	Rectangle Contours: Rectangle Contours on moving objects (Tried)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

	>> make
	>> ./bgsubtraction <Input Video File> <Output Video File Name>

Output:
	
	<Output Video File Name> will be created

Future Work:
	- Rectangle Contours : remove small rectangle contours
	- Background : smooth the background image before canny edge detection
